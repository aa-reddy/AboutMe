I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I was born and brought up in India and I accepted UMass because I loved their Computer Science program. I’ve always been fascinated by computers and here at UMass I have realized that it is indeed my passion. Cybersecurity in particular interests me the most and I wish to pursue it further. I  also enjoy Android Development and I published my first app when I was 17. College has not only taught me more about Computer Science but being a Peer Mentor at UMass has taught me several other things too. I’ve learnt how to work with various different people of different backgrounds and how to push people in the right direction regarding academics. Time management is one of the best skills college teaches a person and I probably have a good grip on it. Especially while trying to balance school work and have fun. I absolutely love the game Dota 2 and I’ve played a bit too much of it but it never gets boring. I also love playing the flute but I barely get to practice as much as I would like. On weekends I usually play pool with friends or go play volleyball outside and try to have a great time.
